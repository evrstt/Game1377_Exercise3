/*
 * Assignment: Asteroids Game - AstroidSpawner Script - PART 2
 * 
 * Objective: Create a functional asteroid spawning script. This script will be responsible for spawning
 * asteroids at the start of the game, as well as spawning smaller asteroids when larger asteroids are destroyed. 
 * ALL ASTEROID SPAWNING SHOULD OCCUR THROUGH THIS SCRIPT. 
 
* Requirements:
* 1. Fill in the SpawnAsteroids method to spawn an asteroid at a location specified by the position and size parameters.
*       Hint: You may need to create a variable for the prefabs you need. 
*       Hint: Use the spawnXMax, spawnXMin, spawnYMax, and spawnYMin variables to determine where the asteroids can spawn.
* 2. Spawn a variable number of asteroids at the start of the game using the SpawnInitialAsteroids() method.
*       This should be determined by a private variable that can be set in the editor (set it to 5 in the Inspector). 
*       The asteroids should spawn at random positions within the camera view, but not too close to the center (0,0)
*       where the player will be (at least 3 units away from the center in any direction).
*       Hint: Vector3.Distance can tell you how far one point is away from another.
