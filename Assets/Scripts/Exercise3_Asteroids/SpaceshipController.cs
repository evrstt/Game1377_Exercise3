/*
 * Assignment: AsteroidsGame - SpaceshipController Script - PART 1 & 2
 * 
 * Objective:
 * Implement a player controller for a spaceship in an Asteroids prototype. The player should be able to rotate the ship,
 * move forward, wrap around the screen, and shoot bullets. 
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * PART 1: Player Movement
 * 1. The player should be able to rotate the ship left and right using A/D keys from an input axis.
 *      This movement should be done with Transform based movement. 
 * 2. The player should be able to thrust forward using only the W key from an input axis
 *      This movement should be done with physics applied to a RigidBody2D. 
 * 3. The player should be able to wrap around the screen when they go off one edge and come back on the other side.
 * 4. The player should be able to teleport to a random location on the screen using left shift in an input button. You 
 *      do not need to check if there is an asteroid there. 
 *      Hint: For determining the random location, you can use the ScreenBounds class (see ScreenWrap.cs for how to use)
 *      
 * PART 2: Shooting
 * 1. The player should be able to shoot bullets using the space key in an input button
 *      Bullets should only go in the direction the ship is facing and bullet speed should be controlled by the Bullet.cs
